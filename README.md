# Task 2: Data Insertion and Handling Nulls

## Objective
Practice inserting, updating, and deleting data using SQL.

## Tools Used
- DB Fiddle / SQLiteStudio / SQL Server

## Description
This task demonstrates how to:
- Insert records into a table (including rows with NULL values)
- Update missing/null fields using `UPDATE` with `WHERE` conditions
- Delete records based on condition using `DELETE`

## Fixes from Previous Version
- Added `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` to prevent duplicate primary key errors if the script is re-run.

## Outcome
A clean, populated `Employees` table with consistent data.
